# Updatedotnet
Update Dotnet is a simple utility to check for updates and silently install updates with minimal user interaction. 

**Disclaimers, Notes, and other important information**

To make this work you need some resources:

- A Web-Host, and a basic understanding of FTP, and file editing. 

- Some HTML/JS knowledge

- Some sort of .NET language knowledge, C#/VB

Things to keep in mind:

- Users will still need to interact some, as the update will require a relaunch to apply the update. 

- You will still need some sort of installer, third party solution, incompatible with ClickOnce or similar technologies. 

- Reccomended to use newer framework than with your application.

Everything is provided "AS IS" no warranties are given or implied. Failure to read the User-Guide will result in catastrophic results.
Intended for non-commercial use, but not restricted. Not intended for large scale projects. 


**Features**

As of right now, this project is a WIP, I have it released in one of my browser projects, LightBrowse, but it needs optomised before released as a reusable solution. 

- Updates with a version cap. Good for licensed upgrades/limited updates.

- Updates with no version cap, good for open source, apps that update often. 

More coming soon.
