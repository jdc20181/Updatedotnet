# Updatedotnet
Update Dotnet is a simple utility to check for updates and silently install updates with minimal user interaction. 

**Disclaimers, Notes, and other important information**

To make this work you need some resources:

- A Web-Host, and a basic understanding of FTP, and file editing. 

- Some HTML/JS knowledge

- Some sort of .NET language knowledge, C#/VB

Things to keep in mind:

- Users will still need to interact some, as the update will require a relaunch to apply the update. 

- You will still need some sort of installer, third party solution, incompatible with ClickOnce or similar technologies. 

- Reccomended to use newer framework than with your application.
